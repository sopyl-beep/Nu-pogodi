# Nu-pogodi
My Java implementation of old, Russian console game "Ну, погоди!".


Game's objective is simple: eggs are rolling down from 4 directions and player needs to catch them before they fall and break, by positioning the Wolf and his basket on time. Everything speeds up overtime, so keeping up is not simple! The more they catch before failing 3 times, the better!

### Some of the things used:
- Panels and grids of Javafx
- Smooth, simultanious animations
- Clickable buttons for the player to control
